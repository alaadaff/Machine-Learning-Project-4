# Machine-Learning-Project-4


Required Project Steps:


1. Set up a new git repository in your GitHub account
2. Think up a map-like environment with treasure, obstacles and opponents
3. Choose a programming language (Python, C/C++, Java)
4. Formulate ideas on how reinforcement learning can be used to find treasure efficiently while avoiding obstacles and opponents
5. Build one or more reinforcement policies to model situational assessments, actions and rewards programmatically
6. Document your process and results
7. Commit your source code, documentation and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub





This project aims to utilize reinforceemnt learning to find treasure within a 5x5 treasure map while avoiding obstacles and maximizing the search through the map. The basic elements of a reinforcement learning problem and which are depicted in the work of this notebook are: the **environment** which represents the world in which the agent operates, the current **state** of the agent, the **feedback** being received from the environment, the **policy** that is used to map an agent's state to actions and the **reward** that an agent would receive if a specific action is to be taken while the agent is in a particular state. 


In this work we implement reinforcement policies that model situational assesments, actions and rewards that have been documented on the Treasure_Hunt.ipynb notebook. The final result that would show the optimal path can also be found in this notebook.
